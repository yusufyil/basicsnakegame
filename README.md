i am developing a basic snakegame that works on command line but it's not working properly, and it has some fps problems.
the game rewriting entire screen for every game circle even not changed areas and thats why game looks horrible. but i have an idea to fix this.
i'll use gotoxy function which can move coursur anywhere in the screen, to write only changed characters in the screen.
