---------i fixed the bugs you can pass first paragraph----------<br />
i am developing a basic snakegame that works on command line but it's not working properly, and it has some fps problems.<br />
the game rewriting entire screen for every game circle even not changed areas and thats why game looks horrible. but i have an idea to fix this.<br />
i'll use gotoxy function which can move coursur anywhere in the screen, to write only changed characters in the screen.<br />
---------how to play------------<br />
you can play game with a,s,d,w keys<br />
w for going up<br />
s for going down<br />
a for going left<br />
d for going right<br />
--------how to adjust game area---------<br />
you change xcoord and ycoord values where on top of the source code, to fit game area to your individual screen i setted them 168 to 50 for my laptop.<br />
-------warning for mac and linux users----------<br />
this code may not be compile in linux or mac computers because of windows.h header file<br />
